This is a small C program for tech fest management system. <br>
This Project mainly has 2 subdivisions (or login systems) viz 1. admin 2. user<br>
1. <b>admin</b>: The Ultimate power of everything lies with the admin hence a password protectected (Encrypted) login is there for admin.<br>
      Admin can Create,Modify,Delete events. Perform whatever operation he/she wants on the user master list <br>
2. <b>User</b>: For user menu there are 3 options (a.New user b.Old User c.Event Info.)<br>
    a.<b>New User</b>: A new person who wants to register for the fest events will choose this.<br>
    b. <b>Old user</b>: A person already registered with the fest wants to register for some more events or wants to get some info about
                 his account or change his/her password will choose this.<br>
    c. <b>Event Info.</b>: A person who isn't part of the techfest event system can choose this option to know about the events information (Date,Timing,Fee,etc)<br>
